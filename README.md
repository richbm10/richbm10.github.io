Udacity Blog Project 1

Project Description:
This web application consists in a personal blog, so it has different blog posts of many topics that can be seen
in the home page. Each blog post is from the person who owns the personal blog. But, in case that the information
is taken from another professional, each post has: the author name, a short bio, and a picture of her/him represented
by an avatar. Besides, the different posts can be shared in social media: pinterest, linkedin, facebook, and twitter.

Objective:
Implement a personal blog using CSS3 and HTML5 best responsive practices, giving a good user experience (UX) and user interface (UI).

Latest Update V1.0.2:
- The header component was removed; instead, a navigation bar component (nav-bar) was implemented.
- For each image, it was added a caption using the HTML5 figcaption element.
- The main CSS file; which is the blog-homepage.css, now imports 4 CSS files.
- The UI of the blog-post-cards section in the index.html was changed. Each card has the gray background color,
and the card content is at the bottom of the image.
- The related-posts section of each HTML post was changed; based on the UI update of the previous point.
- Trailing white spaces and inconsistent code indentation; was fixed using the JS-CSS-HTML formatter extension.
- README file was written.
