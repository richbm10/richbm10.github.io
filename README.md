Udacity Weather Journal App Project

Project Description:
This web application consists in a weather journal for the current weather of a specific location using an ISO country code and ZIP code. The weather information
is obtained by requesting it from the Open Weather Map API ( https://openweathermap.org/api ). The basic content that is displayed is the temperature, and the timezone
date and hour of the location. Besides, depending on the data from the response of the API, there is other content that can be displayed: max and min temperatures,
weather description, how it really feels like, rain, snow, wind, clouds, sunrise, sunset, pressure, sea level, and ground level. The web application is dynamically
built based on the data from the response.

Also, the project includes a node.js local server, which helps for posting the personal opinion of the user of how the weather feels like in that server from the web application.
For achieving this functionality; the server must be running, so it has to be started by running: node local-server.js in the terminal.
